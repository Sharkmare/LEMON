# LEMON
LEMON is a WIP installer for the Neos mod loader, it seeks to simplify the base installation of a modded neos client through use of a simple batch script

LIME is an assistant tool for LEMON, it essentially ensures your LEMON script is up to date before execution (so i if i update dependencies they auto update for you too)
LIME should nto require any updates and always point at this repo
