# LEMON
LEMON is a WIP installer for the Neos mod loader, it seeks to simplify the base installation of a modded neos client through use of a simple batch script

LIME is an assistant tool for LEMON, it essentially ensures your LEMON script is up to date before execution (so i if i update dependencies they auto update for you too)
LIME should nto require any updates and always point at this repo

Alternatively you can manually downlaod NeosModloader [HERE](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader)


## Usage:

> Download either LEMON.bat or LIME.bat

> Either Execute the file or first put it into your neos install directory and then execute it for best results

> Neos Mod loader will be installed an a modded shortcut created on your desktop to launch neos in modded mode

## Capabilities:

Currently LEMON can dowload all NeosModLoader dependencies and automatically install them as well as generate a shortcut to launch neos in modded mode on your desktop
